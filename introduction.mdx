## Fine Tuning, Reimagined

`tuna` is your _one stop (open-source) shop_ for fine tuning a code generation model on any codebase, available publically or privately on GitHub (more VCS support soon!).

We simplify the **entire** process, meaning that all you have to do to build out your perfect model, settings and all, is simply follow the initialization command below!

Don't have an NVIDIA GPU? Don't worry! Make sure you have an RSA SSH Key available at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and set up an account and API key on our GPU provider, [FluidStack](https://fluidstack.io). Minimal prices, maximum development.

If you're concered about Data Privacy and Data Collection, note that Tuna does not collect _any_ data on you, and is entirely open source. Check out the "Data Collection" section below to learn more.

We'd love if you gave us a ⭐, as that's our primary way of tracking user interest! If you're feeling extra generous, you can click Sponsor ❤️. Thank you so much for reading!
