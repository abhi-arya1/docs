</Note>

## Welcome

The Tuna Developer API allows for total automation of instance management, tasks, and more, all through basic HTTP requests, built around the REST specification. All endpoints are managed/found at https://api.tuna.opennote.me.

## Authentication

**All** API endpoints are authenticated using a Bearer header token, which can be created at the [Dashboard](https://tuna.opennote.me/dashboard) for Pro and Enterprise users.

To authenticate, simply add the following header to your request:

```bash
curl -X [METHOD] https://api.tuna.opennote.me \
     -H "Bearer: <api-key>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H ...
     -d '{
  "body": "items go here"
  ...
}'
```
